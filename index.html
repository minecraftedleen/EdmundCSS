                <p><b>Current News: Hainerk is under attack!</b></p>
                Iron Sword forces have begun attacking the city. The emperor has safely evacuated and ordered his men to defend the city until their last breath.
                This is very unfortunate, as the emperor had planned on making Hainerk into a military stronghold and a mining outpost, as well as making it a function city after the war.
                Hopefully, the soldiers at Hainerk can fend off the attack, but things are not looking well for them.
